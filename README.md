# JavaScript-Progress

Goal: To practice JavaScript every day and track my progress.

Through the use of projects and tutorials found online I will develop my JavaScript, HTML, and CSS abilities.
Between projects I will create personal projects from the lessons learned.

This journey official began on April 25th, 2024.
